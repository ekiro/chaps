Welcome to chaps documentation!
=================================

**Chaps** *[Ï‡aps]* is a simple DI library, with IoC container included. It is written in
pure Python with no external dependencies.

Look how easy it is to use:

.. code-block:: python

    from chaps import Container as IoC, Inject, inject

    # import interfaces
    from my_application.core import IDatabase, IUserService


    class MyApp:
        db: IDatabase = Inject()  # dependency as a property

        @inject  # or passed to the constructor
        def __init__(self, user_service: IUserService) -> None:
            self.user_service = user_service

    IoC.autodiscover('my_application')  # find all interfaces and implementations

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = MyApp()
        assert isinstance(app.db, IDatabase)
        assert isinstance(app.user_service, IUserService)
